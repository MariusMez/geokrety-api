# GeoKrety Server API

GeoKrety is an on-line tracking service targeted at Geocachers.
Each registered object, called a GeoKret (plural: GeoKrety),
has a unique tracking code, allowing its movements between locations
such as Geocaches to be tracked and registered on the service.

https://geokrety.org is an open source project started in 2007.
It is developped and maintained by a group of volunters.

Here you'll find the online documentation for the API behind the project.

If you find any bug please open issues on the project GitHub tracker https://github.com/GeoKrety/geokrety-api/issues.



::: warning
#### <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Caution
This is **not yet the production service**. See https://geokrety.org/api.php for the current service API.
